Creating the backend for a polling application using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB involves several steps. Below, I'll provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to implement each of the requirements you've mentioned and document them properly.

Step 1: Project Setup
Create a new Node.js project folder and initialize it with npm init to set up your package.json file.

Install the necessary packages:

bash
Copy code
npm install express mongoose bcrypt jsonwebtoken cors
Create the project structure with folders for models, routes, controllers, and middleware.

Step 2: User Authentication
2.1. User Model
Create a user model in the models directory to define the user schema. Use Mongoose to interact with MongoDB:

javascript
Copy code
// models/User.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, unique: true, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
2.2. User Registration
Create an API endpoint for user registration in the routes directory:

javascript
Copy code
// routes/auth.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const UserController = require('../controllers/userController');

// Endpoint for user registration
router.post('/register', UserController.register);

module.exports = router;
Implement the registration logic in the userController and use bcrypt to hash passwords before storing them in the database.

2.3. User Login and Logout
Create API endpoints for user login and logout in the routes/auth.js file.

2.4. JWT Authentication
Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication. Create middleware to check JWT tokens in protected routes.

Step 3: Poll Management
3.1. Poll Model
Create a poll model in the models directory to define the poll schema:

javascript
Copy code
// models/Poll.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const pollSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  description: String,
  options: [{ text: String, votes: Number }],
  createdBy: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
  participants: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }],
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Poll', pollSchema);
3.2. Poll Routes and Controllers
Create API endpoints for creating, viewing, and participating in polls. Implement the necessary controller functions to handle these actions.

Step 4: Poll Listing
4.1. Poll Listing Routes
Create API endpoints to list all available polls and view details of a specific poll.

4.2. Implement Voting
Allow users to vote for their preferred option in a poll. Update the poll data accordingly.

4.3. Display Poll Results
Display poll results to users after they vote. Calculate and format the results in a user-friendly way.

Step 5: User History
Create an API endpoint for users to view their voting history, including the polls they've participated in and their previous votes.

Step 6: Data Persistence
Use MongoDB to store user data and poll data for persistence. Ensure that you design the database schema efficiently to manage user accounts and polls.

Step 7: Documentation
Document your project using a README file. Include information about installation, usage, API endpoints, database schema, and any other relevant details. Here's a template for your README:

how to upload project on github step by step
ChatGPT
Uploading a project to GitHub involves a series of steps. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to upload your project to GitHub:

Step 1: Create a GitHub Account
If you don't already have a GitHub account, you need to create one. Visit the GitHub website and sign up.

Step 2: Install Git
Ensure that Git is installed on your computer. You can download and install Git from the official website.

Step 3: Create a New Repository on GitHub
Log in to your GitHub account.

Click on the "+" icon in the upper-right corner of the GitHub dashboard and select "New Repository."

Fill in the repository name, description, and other settings according to your preferences. You can choose whether the repository should be public or private. For version control purposes, it's common to choose "Initialize this repository with a README" to create an initial README file.

Click the "Create repository" button.

Step 4: Initialize a Git Repository Locally
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your project.

Initialize a new Git repository in your project directory:

bash
Copy code
git init
Link your local Git repository to the GitHub repository you created by setting the remote URL:

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
Replace yourusername with your GitHub username and your-repo-name with the name of the repository you created.

Step 5: Add and Commit Your Project Files
Add all your project files to the staging area. You can use the following command to add all files:

bash
Copy code
git add .
Or add specific files individually:

bash
Copy code
git add file1 file2 ...
Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Step 6: Push Your Project to GitHub
Push your local repository to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git push -u origin master
If you are working with a branch other than master, replace master with the name of your branch.

Step 7: Verify Your Repository on GitHub
Visit your GitHub repository page in your web browser. You should see your project files and folders there. Congratulations, your project is now on GitHub!

Step 8: Keep Your Repository Updated
As you continue to work on your project, make sure to commit and push changes to GitHub regularly to keep your repository up to date.

To commit changes:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
To push changes to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git push origin master
You can also use Git branches for different features or bug fixes and push them to separate branches on your GitHub repository.

That's it! You've successfully uploaded your project to GitHub, and you can now collaborate with others, track changes, and maintain version control for your project.
